# Mikrotik - RouterOS - Introduction

## Mikrotik
[SIA Mikrotīkls](https://mikrotik.com/aboutus) is a Latvian company developing routers, switches and ISP systems, etc under the brand Mikrotik.

## RouterOS : Not an open source router operating system
[RouterOS](https://mikrotik.com/software) is the operating system of RouterBoard products. 

It powers MikroTik hardware devices. It also is available for virtual machines.

Technically, it is [based on the Linux kernel](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Getting+started). It contains [some open source software](https://mikrotik.com/downloadterms.html).

Yet, the Mikrotik RouterOS software sitting on top of the Linux kernel is **proprietary**. 

RouterOS also is a [closed system](packages.md#closed-system). It requires a [license key](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/RouterOS+license+keys) (a free demo license key is available). 

Some [modified Linux kernel source code](routeros-source-code.md) has been released.

## A side note about SwOS

Some switches/routers are sold with a RouterOS/SwOS dual-boot. 

According to Mikrotik:

*"[SwOS](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/SWOS/SwOS) is an operating system designed specifically for administration of MikroTik switch products. SwOS is configurable from your web browser. It gives you all the basic functionality for a managed switch, plus more: allows to manage port-to-port forwarding, broadcast storm control, apply MAC filter, configure VLANs, mirror traffic, apply bandwidth limitation and even adjust some MAC and IP header fields"*.
